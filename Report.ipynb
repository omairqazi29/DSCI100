    "   Glass is a ubiquitous material that can be found at most crime scenes. The classification of glass fragments is an essential aspect of forensic investigation, particularly in cases that involve broken windows, bottles and/or any other glass objects that can be found present. It can provide crucial evidence that may help investigators identify suspects or even vindicate the innocent. Glass fragments can be found on clothing and vehicles in addition to being recovered from wounds and weapons. These fragments can provide valuable clues about the source, direction and nature of the impact that led to them to break, which can be useful to investigators when reconstructing the sequence of events leading up to the crime. However, not all glass is created equal, and the classification of glass is essential to determining its origin and potential significance as well as for ruling out false matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "   An article written by Grzegorz Zadora titled Glass analysis for forensic purposes- a comparison of classification methods states that many forensic experts analyze glass fragments under 0.5mm, therefore they must be able to accurately collect the physico-chemical features of the glass, such as Refractive Index (RI) in addition to elemental analysis. By using Scanning Electron Microscopy that has been coupled with an Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX), the investigators are provided with the information of major and minor elements such as Al, Mg, K, Ca and Fe. Furthermore, it is believed that obtaining the information about such elements are extremely important when comparing and individualizing the glass fragments (Zadora, G. 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "    #talk here about what we obtain for data results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The dataset used was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The chosen dataset, Glass Identification comes from the USA Forensic Science Service and classifies 6 types of glass based on their oxide content, along with the refractive index of each glass observation. Also note that float-processing is a glass manufacturing process that creates a smooth, thick and uniform surface. In this dataset, there is no data for “vehicle_windows_non_float_processed” glass.\n",
